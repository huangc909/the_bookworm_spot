The BookWorm Spot app provides users a space to store their personal reading experience by being able to add books into the app, record a note for each book, and check off whether or not the book is on their wishlist and/or has been read already.

## Planning/Coding Experience
I first started with creating the user stories for my app. Afterwards, I began to work on the wireframes and ERD. Then, I started to code the backend using Django and Python. Once I tested out the MVP features, I began to work on the front end using React Hooks.

As I was working, I would jot down additional ideas of features that I would like to add after I was finished with the MVP version. If I ran into an issue, I would turn to my software engineering community and post issues.

Once I finished with the MVP, I went back into Django and added the feature of allowing all clients who visit the app site to see the recently added books. Then, on the front end, I made sure to have only the book title, author, rating and owner name shown to those who did not have an account yet, did not sign in, or did not own the book. I've also added a default image to each individual book so that in the future, I can add a cloud-base database and have users upload their own book covers. Afterward adding a few new features, I began to style the app using React Bootstrap, Flexbox, JSX, and CSS.

## Unsolved Problems
Some unsolved problems that I would like to go back to are:
- adding a username property to the user
- using a cloud-base database to store book covers
- add authentication when viewing a book (1. owners can view all the information they included in their book while being able to update and delete their book, 2. non-owners can only view limited information and cannot update or delete any books not belonged to them.)
- stylizing the forms
